# PKEdit QT

Cross-platform desktop graphical user interface for editing Pokemon save files using libpkedit.
This is my first time using QT so my apologies for the ugly code. I was in a bit of a rush.
Nonetheless, it works well enough (I hope).

## Features

- Works on Windows, MacOS, Linux
- One-click button to simulate trade evolutions for Pokemon who evolve by trading
- Automatic save file backups by default
- Modifying IVs, EVs, level, or species will automatically update the Pokemon's stats
- Allows modification of trainer info, money, coins, Pokemon, and items
- Move legality checker
- Updates Pokemon EXP to make it legal when modifying the level
- And more!
